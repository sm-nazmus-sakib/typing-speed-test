            1. What are the difference local storage and session storage ?
        </h3>
        <p>
            i) data in localStorage doesn't expire, data in sessionStorage is cleared when the page session ends.
            <br>
            ii) The storage capacity of session storage is 5MB but The storage capacity of local storage is 5MB/10MB.
        </p>

        <h3>2. What are the difference between global scope and block scope.?</h3>
        <p>Global Scope:
            The variables defined outside of any function or curly brackets are known as global variables and have
            global scope. Global scope means that the variables can be accessed from any part of that program, any
            function or conditional state can access that variable.
            Block Scope:
            Block scope is also a sub-type of local scope. The block scope can be defined as the scope of the variables
            inside the curly brackets {}. Now, these curly brackets can be of loops, or conditional statements, or
            something else. You are only allowed to refer to these variables from within the curly brackets {}.</p>


        <h3>3. How does event loop in js work?</h3>
        <p>i) The event loop is a mechanism that allows JavaScript to perform non-blocking operations. When an
            asynchronous
            task is started, the event loop will start running. Once the task is completed, the event loop will again
            check
            for any other tasks that need to be performed. <br>

            ii) The event loop waits for the function stack to be empty, once the call stack is empty this will push the
            first function from the event queue to the call stack</p>


        <h3> 4. How many ways we get undefined?</h3>
        <p>
            i) variable that is not initialized <br>
            ii) Function with no return <br>
            iii) Parameter is not passed <br>
            iv) If return has nothing on the right side will return undefined <br>
            v) Property that does not exist on an the object <br>
            vi) Accessing array element outside of the index range <br>
            vii) Deleting an a element inside an array <br>
            viii) Set a value directly to undefine.
        </p>
